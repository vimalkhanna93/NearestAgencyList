=================

This application gives you list of real estate agency sorted based on distance. 

Steps to run the application:
-----------------------------
1. Enter 2 different addresses in the input boxes. 
2. Click search button 
3. The application lists the nearest real estate agencies sorted according to the distance

Technical aspects of the application:
I used Javascript and JQuery along with HTML to develop the application. I fetched the data about real estate agencies and places from Google Places API. I fetch the geo location co-ordinates of the listed address initially and finds the real estate agencies in the 10 miles radius of it and sort them in ascenting order based on the sum up values of the place from both address.
